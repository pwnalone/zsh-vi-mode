# Zsh Vi Mode Plugin

This is a _minimalist_ plugin to improve Zsh's **vi mode**. It includes the following features.

- Allow use of the `hjkl` keys for movement within completion menus
- Restore overwritten characters when hitting backspace in Vi replace mode

More features may be added in the future.
